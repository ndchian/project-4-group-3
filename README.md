## Project Overview:
 Predicting if a set of mushrooms is edible or not corresponds to the task of classifying them into two groupsâ€”edible or poisonous. To support this binary task, the largest and most comprehensive attribute-based data available is collected. Thanks to natural language processing, the primary data are based on a textbook for mushroom identification and contain 173 species from 23 families.
    
    
  

### Dataset: 
[Secondary Mushroom](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/848/secondary+mushroom+dataset)

The dataset is in the .csv format and contains more than 22,000 rows and 16 columns. It includes 61069 hypothetical mushrooms with caps based on 173 species (i.e. 353 mushrooms per species). Each mushroom is identified as definitely edible, definitely poisonous, or of unknown edibility and not recommended (the latter class was combined with the poisonous class).
