        "### Optimization\n",
        "\n",
        "For both the logistic regression model and the random forest classifier, the PCA data was used in a second iteration for each model type. This increased the accuracy readings for both models at least 16%.\n",
        "\n",
        "For the gradient boosted tree model, our initial model had already achieved 100% accuracy, but we wanted to provide a way to be able to optimize this model if we needed it. In the initial model, the `num_trees` had 100 trees as the input and one way to optimize the model is to increase this number. In the example we provided in the notebook, this was increased to 1,000 trees which also achieved 100% accuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Final Results\n",
        "\n",
        "The random forest model trained on PCA data dramatically outperformed the logistic regression model with either the original dataset or PCA as well as the random forest model with original data. In a use case like this that is safety-related, it is crucial to obtain a near-perfect accuracy. Likewise, another major component is eliminating as many false negatives as possible. The precision and recall values for both outcomes are 98-99%.\n",
        "\n",
        "The YDF gradient boosted trees model did come in with 100% accuracy in identifying the edible and poisonous mushrooms. However, this model type does have a drawback of being more likely to overfit the data. For the best quality results, both the gradient boosted tree and random forest results should be taken into account.\n",
        "\n",
        "The logistic regression model with pca data, while maintaining a recall for poisonous outcomes at 79%, still struggles to keep an overall accuracy of 72%, compared to the random forest model's 99%. This indicates that the pca is complex enough that it requires an algorithm more nuanced than a simple regression.\n",
        "\n",
        "The worst performing models were the ones trained on the regular, unoptimized dataset. Trained on this data, the random forest and logistic regression algorithms had accuracy scores of 52% and 56%, respectively. Based on these performance metrics, data optimization was a huge help in achieving the desired results.\n",
        "\n",
        "The confusion matrices and accuracy results can be found in either our slide deck or in the 'Results' folder of this repository as can the YDF gradient boosted model tree. If you are running our notebook, best results will be achieved in using Google Colab."
