        "By far, the random forest model train on PCA data dramatically outperformed the other models. In a case use like this that is safety-related, it it crucial to obtain a near-perfect accuracy. Likewise, another major component is eliminating as much false negatives as possible. The precision and recall values for both outcomes are 98-99%.\n",
        "\n",
        "The logistic regression model with pca data, while maintaining a recall for poisonous outcomes at 81%, still struggles to keep an overall accuracy of 72%, compared to the random forest model's 99%. This indicates that the pca is complex enough that it requires an algorithm more nuanced than a simple regression.\n",

Trained on this data, the random forest and logistic regression algorithms had accuracy scores of 50% and 55%, respectively. Based on these performance metrics, data optimization was a huge help in achieving the desired results."
